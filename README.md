_suda_ is a plugin to read or write files with `sudo` command.

This plugin was built while `:w !sudo tee % > /dev/null` trick does not work on [neovim][].

https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1716

This plugin is strongly inspired by [sudo.vim][] but the interfaces was aggressively modified for modern Vim script.

## Usage

Use `suda://` prefix in `read`, `edit`, `write`, or `saveas` commands.

```vim
" Open a current file with sudo
:e suda://%

" Save a current file with sudo
:w suda://%

" Edit /etc/sudoers
:e suda:///etc/sudoers

" Read /etc/sudoers (insert content under the cursor)
:r suda:///etc/sudoers

" Read /etc/sudoers at the end
:$r suda:///etc/sudoers

" Write contents to /etc/profile
:w suda:///etc/profile

" Save contents to /etc/profile
:saveas suda:///etc/profile
```

You can change the protocol prefix with `g:suda#prefix`.

```vim
let g:suda#prefix = 'suda://'
" multiple protocols can be defined too
let g:suda#prefix = ['suda://', 'sudo://', '_://']
```

And you can change the prompt string with `g:suda#prompt`.

```vim
" 'Password' in french
let g:suda#prompt = 'Mot de passe: '
```

Or you can disable trying to run sudo without entering a password (e.g. when using neovim).

```vim
let g:suda#try_without_password = !has('nvim')
```

### Smart edit

When `let g:suda_smart_edit = 1` is written in your vimrc, suda automatically switch a buffer name when the target file is not readable or writable.

In short,

```
$ vim /etc/hosts
```

or

```
:e /etc/shadow
```

Will open `suda:///etc/hosts` or `suda:///etc/shadow` instead of `/etc/hosts` or `/etc/shadow` because that files are not writable or not readable.

### Windows

Install [mattn/sudo](https://github.com/mattn/sudo) to enable this plugin in Windows.
Make sure that the following shows `1`.

```vim
: echo executable('sudo')
```
